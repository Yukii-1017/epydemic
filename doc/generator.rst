:class:`NetworkGenerator`: Generate instances from a class of random networks
=============================================================================

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

.. versionadded :: 1.0.0
   Generators remove the need for sub-classing the dynamics classes in order
   to build instances of particular types of network, and also improve
   experiment reproducibility.

.. autoclass:: NetworkGenerator
   :show-inheritance:


Defining the class of network
-----------------------------

The class of network generated by the generator is defined
by sub-classing and overriding the :meth:`_generate` method.
This will make use of the experimental parameters governing the experiment
in which the network is used. 

.. automethod :: NetworkGenerator.set

.. automethod :: NetworkGenerator._generate

See :ref:`standard-generators` for the built-in generators that create the most common
kinds of network. See :ref:`build-generators`  for an example of how to define
a new generator.


Single instance generation
--------------------------

.. automethod :: NetworkGenerator.generate


Multiple instance generation (iteration)
----------------------------------------

:class:`NetworkGenerator` exports an iterator interface to allow the
class of networks to be sampled repeatedly.

.. automethod :: NetworkGenerator.__iter__

.. automethod :: NetworkGenerator.__next__
