Getting started
===============

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

Select a disease model
-----------------------

``epydemic`` comes with several disease models built-in. We'll start with the :term:`SIR` model
with probabilistic recovery, as this is one of the most common in the literature and models
diseases such as measles ort flus: once you've been infected, you can't be re-infected.

.. code-block:: python

   import epydemic
   import epyc

   model = epydemic.SIR()


Create a network
----------------

The epidemic needs a network to run over. While it's not a very accurate model of a real population, we'll
use the Erdos-Renyi network with a given number of nodes and mean degree. ``networkx`` can create such networks
using a random process. Since we want the epidemic to potentially be able to infect the whole network, we're only
interested in the largest connected component. And since we don't let people infect themselves, we don't want
any self-loops. This leads to:

.. code-block:: python

   import networkx

   # create the network
   N = 10000                               # number of nodes in the network
   kmean = 5                               # mean degree of a node
   phi = (kmean + 0.0) / N                 # probability of two nodes being connected
   g = networkx.erdos_renyi_graph(N, phi)

   # clean the network
   g = g.subgraph(max(networkx.connected_components(g), key = len)).copy()
   g.remove_edges_from(list(g.selfloop_edges()))

We now have a "simple" network, connected and without self-loops, over which to run the epidemic.


Select a process dynamics
-------------------------

We now need to run the epidemic over the network. To do this we need to select a process dynamics. Generally speaking
it is best to use the :class:`CompartmentedStochasticDynamics` class, which will run the epidemic in
continuous time. (We could alternatively use the :class:`CompartmentedSynchronousDynamics` class and
run the epidemic in discrete time.)

.. code-block:: python

   e = epydemic.CompartmentedStochasticDynamics(m, g)

The dynamics object ``e`` binds the disease model to the network ready to be run.


Run the epidemic
----------------

To run the epidemic, we need to provide the dynamics with the parameters that the disease model needs. The dynakics
is actually an ``epyc`` experiment, so we provide the parameters as a dict.

What parameters does the SIR model take? Looking at its documentation (:class:`SIR`) it takes three
parameters with the following keys and meanings:

* :attr:`SIR.P_INFECTED`: the probability of a node initially being infected

* :attr:`SIR.P_INFECT`: the probability of an infected node infecting a neighbouring susceptible node

* :attr:`SIR.P_REMOVE`: the probability of a node recovering

We can build a dict giving values to these three parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   param = dict()
   param[epydemic.SIR.P_INFECTED] = 0.01
   param[epydemic.SIR.P_INFECT] = 0.1
   param[epydemic.SIR.P_REMOVE] = 0.05

To run the simulation, we first call the ``set()`` method on the dynamics object to set the disease parameters,
and then call the ``run()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   rc = e.set(params).run()

Time then passes....


Get the results
---------------

When the simulation run finishes we are returned a dict of dicts holding the experimental results and some
metadata. If we concentrate just on the experimental results:

.. code-block:: python

   rc[epyc.Experiment.RESULTS]

we'll see something like this:

.. code-block:: python

   {''I': 0, 'S': 9821, 'R': 110}

What does this mean? The dict holds the sizes of the three SIR compartments, susceptible (``S``, also
known as :attr:`SIR.SUSCEPTIBLE`), infected (``I``), and removed (``R``). What this result shows is that
we have no nodes in the infected compartment (the epidemic has died out, and no-one else can be infected); 9821
nodes still in the susceptible compartment who have never been infected; and 110 nodes who had the disease and have
recovered (or been removed) from it.


Re-running the epidemic
-----------------------

But wait! -- is this the whole story? Well clearly not, because a disease is a stochastic process depending on
random factors. Another epidemic with the *same* parameters on the *same* network  might generate a
*different* result.

We can check this by re-running the experiment again:

.. code-block:: python

   (e.run())[epyc.Experiment.RESULTS]

Notice that we didn't have to re-set the parameters: the experiment just re-used the ones already set. Looking at
the results we might see:

.. code-block:: python

  {'I': 0, 'S': 9807, 'R': 124}

Slightly more nodes were infected this time and therefore ended up removed (124 in the ``R`` compartment). If we
ran the process again, we could see a different result again: the results could all be similar, or might possibly
show some dramatic variation such as not having anyone at all becoming infected other than those who initially were.


Larger scale: explore infection rates
-------------------------------------

It would clearly be tedious and error-prone to perform lots of repetiions by hand, and even more so if we wanted
to see, for example, whether changing the infection probability made a difference. Fortunately, because ``epydemic`` uses
``epyc`` to manage its execution, we can use ``epyc``'s ``Lab`` class to automate the process.

Let's run a larger experiment, performing repeated simulations for several different infection values. Without getting
caught up in how ``epyc`` works (there's a `web site for that <https://epyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_), we can just
jump straight in:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy

   # create a notebook for results and a lab in which to run the experiments
   nb = epyc.JSONLabNotebook('sir-experiments.json')
   lab = epyc.Lab(nb)

   # build the parameter space, where P_INFECT ranges from 0.01 to 1.0 in 10 steps
   lab[epydemic.SIR.P_INFECTED] = 0.01
   lab[epydemic.SIR.P_INFECT] = numpy.linspace(0.01, 1.0, num = 10, endpoint = True)
   lab[epydemic.SIR.P_REMOVE] = 0.05

   # run 5 repetitions of the experiment at each point in the parameter space
   lab.runExperiment(eypc.RepeatedExperiment(e, 5))

Significantly more time passes -- unsurprisingly, since we're doing 50 experimental runs (5 repetitions at each of
10 points in the parameter space, varying the infection probability each time). We can then retrieve all the results
and import them directly into ``pandas`` for analysis:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas

   df = lab.dataframe()
