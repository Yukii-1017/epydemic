:class:`Process`: Base class for network processes
==================================================

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

.. autoclass:: Process


Core methods
------------

Five methods provide the core API for defining new processes, and are typically overridden by sub-classes.

.. automethod:: Process.reset

.. automethod:: Process.build

.. automethod:: Process.setUp

.. automethod:: Process.tearDown

.. automethod:: Process.atEquilibrium

.. automethod:: Process.results


Getting ready to run
--------------------

Several other methods provide information for the process.

.. automethod:: Process.setNetwork

.. automethod:: Process.network

.. automethod:: Process.setMaximumTime

.. automethod:: Process.maximumTime


Accessing and evolving the network
----------------------------------

A process will generally want to access the working network in the course of its execution,
mainly in event functions. Accessing the network can be done directly, through :meth:`network`:
however, processes often need to track changes made to the network, and for this reason the
class provides an interface for evolving the network, paralleling the methods available
in `networkx`.

The interface may be overridden and extended by sub-classes. Three methods form the general core.

.. automethod:: Process.addNode

.. automethod:: Process.removeNode

.. automethod:: Process.addEdge

.. automethod:: Process.removeEdge

four other "bulk" methods are deinfed in terms of the basic methods, and so don't typically
need to be overridden specifically.

.. automethod:: Process.addNodesFrom

.. automethod:: Process.removeNodesFrom

.. automethod:: Process.addEdgesFrom

.. automethod:: Process.removeEdgesFrom


Loci
----

Loci are the "locations" at which things happen. The purpose of a :class:`Locus` is to keep
track of something -- a set of nodes, the entire network, and so forth -- so that
simulation can proceed efficiently.

.. automethod:: Process.addLocus

.. automethod:: Process.locus

Loci also provide an operator interface.

.. automethod:: Process.__getitem__

.. automethod:: Process.__setitem__

.. automethod:: Process.__contains__

.. automethod:: Process.__iter__


Events
------

Events are the code fragments that run as part of the simulation. The collection
of events defined by a process form all the possible actions that the simulation
will perform.

There are three broad classes of events. *Per-element* events occur with a probability
on each element of a locis. This means that loci with more elements will generate a higher
rate of events.

.. automethod:: Process.addEventPerElement

*Fixed-rate* events, by contrast, occur with a probability that's independent of the
number of elements in a locus, as long as it's not empty. This means that the rate at
which such events fire is independent of the size of the locus.

.. automethod:: Process.addFixedRateEvent

These two kinds of events are both *stochastic*, in the sense that they are generated according
to an exponential probability distribution.

In contrast, *posted* events are set to occur at a particular simulation time. As the
simulation proceeds it will execute posted events in the correct time sequence relative
to the different stochastic events that are generated.

.. automethod:: Process.postEvent

.. automethod:: Process.postRepeatingEvent


Accessing event distributions
-----------------------------

The different sets of events can be accessed procedurally. This is typically only needed
if writing a new :class:`Dynamics` sub-class.

.. automethod:: Process.perElementEventDistribution

.. automethod:: Process.fixedRateEventDistribution

.. automethod:: Process.eventRateDistribution

For posted events, there is similarly an interface to access the events needing to be fired.

.. automethod:: Process.nextPendingEventBefore

.. automethod:: Process.pendingEvents
